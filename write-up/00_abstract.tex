We propose \xin---the proportion of papers' citations coming from outside their research field---and use this metric to analyze citations of CHI, UIST, and CSCW papers between 2010 and 2022.
We found an overall decreasing \xin by several measures, indicating that HCI papers have been more and more likely to be cited by HCI papers rather than by non-HCI papers.
