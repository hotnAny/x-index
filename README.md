# X-index: Analyzing How Much HCI Papers Are Cited Beyond Core HCI Venues

## What's X-index?
X-index is a simple metric that measures how often a paper's citations cross the disciplinary boundaries.

Given a set of venues representing a research field, the X-index of the papers in this field is defined as the proportion of citations of these papers *not* coming from these venues.

## What's here in this repo?
* A list of core HCI venues to define what is (not) an HCI paper;
* Citation data of CHI/UIST/CSCW papers between 2010 and 2020 (i.e., lists of papers that cite these HCI papers), in ```.ris``` format;
* A python script to perform some analyses of HCI's X-index

## Cite as
TBA.
